<b>Streamline unit testing</b> in Dynamics CRM by faking the `IOrganizationService` to work with an in-memory context.

<b>Drive your development</b> by unit testing any plugin, code activity, or 3rd party app using the `OrganizationService` easier and faster than ever before.

Supports Dynamics CRM 2011, 2013, 2015, 2016, and Dynamics 365 (8.x and 9.x). <b>NOTE:</b> With the release of Dynamics 365 v9 we are changing the naming convention for new packages to match the major version.

## Semantic Versioning

The NuGet packages use semantic versioning like this:

    x.y.z  => Major.Minor.Patch
       
x: stands for the major version. The package is very stable so that's why the major version didn't change yet.

y: minor version. Any minor updates add new functionality without breaking changes. An example of these would be a new operator or a new fake message executor.

z: patch. Any update to this number means new bug fixes for the existing functionality. A new minor version might also include bug fixes too.

## Roadmap

*  TODO:  Add support for date operators. See `ConditionOperator` implementation status [here](https://github.com/jordimontana82/fake-xrm-easy/blob/master/FakeXrmEasy.Tests.Shared/FakeContextTests/FetchXml/ConditionOperatorTests.cs#L19-L110). Feel free to add missing ones!
*  TODO: Implement remaining CRM messages. To know which ones have been implemented so far, see `FakeMessageExecutor` implementation status [here](https://github.com/jordimontana82/fake-xrm-easy/tree/master/FakeXrmEasy.Shared/FakeMessageExecutors).
*  TODO: Increase test coverage.
